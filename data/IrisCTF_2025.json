In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!\n\nYou do not need to transmit for any of these challenges. You do not need any radio hardware for any of these challenges. All of these challenges were made to be solved without the need for real-life hardware.\n\nThis disclaimer isn't meant to deter.

Once again, this is not legal advice, and you do not need to transmit for any of these challenges.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's start with a simple challenge to prove some basic competency before we get into the more advanced stuff.
