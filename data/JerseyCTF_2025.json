To help keep the challenge fair, we've setup a relay. Sending a packet to whats-your-number-relay.aws.jerseyctf.com (resolve the IP address) will rewrite the source address to 1.2.3.4 and forward it to whats-your-number.aws.jerseyctf.com. Nothing else is changed besides the source and destination IP address.\n\nPlease note that being behind a NAT or firewall may still prevent the required packets from going through.
