Also, there are some other suspicious data in the output. Since the real value of flag is hidden, let's find it out from challenge.py and its output!\n    The original flag is a string (more precisely, a byte string), but to encrypt it, it is converted to the corresponding integer m with the code m = int.from_bytes(flag, 'big'). If you get m, then you can obtain the flag with the code m.to_bytes((m.bit_length()-1)//8 + 1, 'big').\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TSG/2024/crypto/Mystery_of_Scattered_Key/mystery_of_scattered_key.tar.gz"]}, {"name": "Who is the Outlier", "desc": "Author: jiei_univ\n\nMy voting system should protect the ballot secrecy, even if the data sent to the cloud for aggregation is leaked.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TSG/2024/crypto/Who_is_the_Outlier/who_is_outlier.tar.gz"]}], "misc": [{"name": "Cached File Viewer", "desc": "Author: azatorium08\n\nI implemented a simple file viewer!\n\n> ls ~\n99-bottles-of-bear.txt  chal  diary.txt  flag  recipe.txt  start.sh\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TSG/2024/misc/Cached_File_Viewer/file_viewer.tar.gz"]}, {"name": "Cached File Viewer 2", "desc": "Author: azatorium08\n\n\ud83e\udee8\ud83e\udee8\n\nThis is the modified version of \"Cached File Viewer\".\nPlease extract the attached file using the flag from the Cached File Viewer as the password.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TSG/2024/misc/Cached_File_Viewer_2/file_viewer2.tar.gz.zip"]}, {"name": "H star", "desc": "Author: moratorium08\n\nThis paper introduces a refinement type system for Haskell.

Upon successful verification, the refinement type annotations are removed, and the original program is compiled with GHC for execution.\n\nOur empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this tool across various real-world programs.
