They managed to revoke our login credentials, effectively locking us out! Let's embark on a journey to hack them back! To do so, we first need to understand the hybrid low-energy extra-low memory complexity achitecture the satellite's processor uses...\n\nThe blueprints\n\n    Luckily, one of the developers has kept the manual referencing all the opcodes, plus a test program written in the language! Don't you think finding a way to run this program would be useful?\n\nHere is the manual:\n\nVersion: 0.7.0\n\nIntroducing Dread-ASM, the all-in-one assembly language that can be natively executed on all modern satellites! It runs on an architeccture that has the following properties:\nRegisters:\n\nthe usual RIP to count instructions\nR0 and R1 registers for calculus\nLCT is the loop count register. It keeps the index of the current loop within the program\nPTR is a register that keeps a pointer to one of the cells of the buffer\n\nThe holy buffer\n\nThis super duper cool architecture has a whole 32*8 bit buffer, capable of holding up to 32 8-bit integers! Some may argue that it isn't enough, but it's only because their code isn't optimized enough!\n\nBasic operations:\n\nADD R1 R2 : R1 <- (R1 + R2) % 0xff\nMOV R1 cst : R1 <- cst\nXOR R1 R2 : R1 <- R1 ^ (R2 + 3) % 0xff and no, this is not a bug, it's a feature!\nCMP R1 R2 : classic comparison between R1 and R2\nCLP cst: classic comparison between LCT and cst\n\nFlow control:\n\nthree flags : is_bigger, is_equal and is_smaller\nJRA cst : rip <- rip + cst ; you can read this opcode \"jump relative always\"\nJRG cst : rip <- rip + cst if is_bigger flag set ; it reads \"jump relative greater\"\nJRE cst : rip <- rip + cst if is_equal flag set ; it reads \"jump relative equal\"\nJRL cst : rip <- rip + cst if is_smaller flag set ; it reads \"jump relative lower\"\nINL cst: LCT = cst\nICL : LCT += 1\nSPL: PTR = LCT\n\npointers and data:\n\nLDA : R0 <- buf[PTR]\nIPT : PTR <- (PTR + 3) % 32 ; The boss Jeb really wanted this feature, so here it is --'\nLPT RI : RI <- PTR\nSTD RI : buf[PTR] <- RI\n\nAdditional properties:\n\nThe buffer is initialized with only zeroes.\nAll registers are initialized with a value equal to 1, except rip which starts at 0.\nThe comparison flags are set to True by default\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/THCon/2024/rev/Dread_ASM_Part_1/chall1.dreadasm"]}, {"name": "Dread ASM Part 2", "desc": "Medium DreadFog\n\n    Great! being able to execute satellite firmware will come in handy!
