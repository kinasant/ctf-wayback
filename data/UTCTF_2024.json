A fellow intern has already found a stack pointer leak, so you know that a stack pointer on the server is 0x7c974a30. Good luck!\n\nThe hosted website is an emulated version of a real router bought on Amazon. The emulated firmware was dumped directly off a real device. If your exploit is written well, it will work on real routers in the wild. Please use your exploit responsibly - ISSS claims no responsiblity for your behavior. If you find a zero day, please disclose it appropriately to the relevant manufacturer(s). A script will automatically restart the router if it has crashed. If you can't access it after 10 minutes, please message an officer.\n\nThe firmware can be found here.\n\n    Note that due to networking constraints, you will need to connect over a bind shell. Ports 1336-1440 inclusive will be forwarded to the router.\n\nBy Aadhithya (@aadhi0319 on discord)\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/UTCTF/2024/pwn/E_Corp/TLWR940N.bin"]}], "rev": [{"name": "Accelerated Hell", "desc": "Not all pain is gain.\n\nBy Jeriah (@jyu on discord)\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/UTCTF/2024/rev/Accelerated_Hell/main"]}, {"name": "Beginner Basic Reversing Problem", "desc": "So many function calls... but are they that different?\n\nBy Khael (@malfuncti0nal on discord)\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/UTCTF/2024/rev/Beginner_Basic_Reversing_Problem/baby-rev"]}, {"name": "Fruit Deals", "desc": "I found a excel sheet with some great deals thanks to some random guy on the internet!
