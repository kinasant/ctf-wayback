New cryptanalytic methods exposed vulnerabilities in many established ciphers, casting doubt on the long-term security of systems once thought to be invulnerable. In response, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to find a successor to the aging DES. In 2000, Rijndael was chosen, setting a new standard for secure encryption. But even as AES became widely adopted, new challenges, like quantum computing, loomed on the horizon.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Srdnlen/2025/crypto/Based_sbox/server.py"]}, {"name": "Chess", "desc": "fiara\n\nLook at this cool encoding, it's made for chess lovers!!
