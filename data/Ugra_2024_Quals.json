Always like this with him: seems like he\u2019s just babbling nonsense, but then he says something smart. Why is he looking at me like that\u2026 And why isn\u2019t he keeping an eye on the servers? Hoping there won\u2019t be any issues and he won\u2019t get pinned down? Or is he not hoping, but being certain? So, are there juniors sitting there or just scripts?..\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve played with Nix, I did\u2026 F-function? Well, it doesn\u2019t affect anything\u2026\"\n\n\u201cUh-huh, so if you expose a function interpreter in the API without side effects and feed it an argument like your account key, nothing bad will happen?\"\n\nVovan took another sip.
