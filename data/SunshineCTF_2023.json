That was too many.\nThis year, we used an already existing vulnerability (edit: aaaaaaaaaand it's patched, and like a day after we made this challenge... which was months ago), for minimum effort. And the flag, dude, is like, fully there, when you find it. Not half there. No risk of guessing.\nThis year, we introduce:\nThe low-effort wave \ud83c\udf0a\nRide the wave man. \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\nThe wave is life.

Something's broken with it. I don't know dude.\nIt also doesn't work. Can you fix this for me?
