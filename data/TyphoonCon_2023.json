It's like a room with really bouncy walls that make your voice bounce back to you.\nIn this room, there are only people who think and say the same things. They agree on everything and never question their ideas. When someone talks, their words bounce back and everyone else in the room hears the same thing over and over again.\nSo, an echo chamber is like being in a room with people who always think the same way as you do and say the same things. They only listen to ideas that they already agree with, and they don't hear different opinions or ideas from other people.\nIt's important to remember that it's good to listen to different ideas and opinions, even if we don't always agree with them. That way, we can learn new things and understand the world better.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/Echo_Time/libc-2.27.so", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/Echo_Time/task"]}, {"name": "TruboFan is no Fun", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/Dockerfile", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/d8", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/flag.txt", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/patch.patch", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/run", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/pwn/TruboFan_is_no_Fun/snapshot_blob.bin"], "desc": "A vulnerability has been introduced into the v8 engine.\nYour goal is to trigger the vulnerability, to achieve a read primitive and use that to read the flag from the memory.\nWe are providing:\nv8 compiled with the vulnerability\nDockerfile that you can use to run the engine (you need to run it with --privileged to work properly)\nA fake flag for you to try and read\npatch.patch That shows the vulnerability we introduced\nrun which is the v8 runner - allowing you to see the flow and the flag loading\nsnapshot_blob.bin a binary to runs the v8 engine (provides its environment)\nAs the challenge is quite complex, we will be awaring it a big amount of points.\nAs there is no easy way to run it in a secure environment - once you have solved it - send the solution to: info@typhooncon.com\nSolution MUST contain:\nJavascript code that solves challenge\nA technical writeup of what you are doing, where/what the vulnerability is, how you exploit it - it must show root cause analysis of the vulnerability, it must show how you are exploiting the vulnerability to reveal the flag\n"}], "rev": [{"name": "Dumb Internet of Things part 1", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TyphoonCon/2023/rev/Dumb_Internet_of_Things_part_1/Device.dump"], "desc": "Some employee from the engineering team at DumbIOT inc. got drunk and left the prototype of some new sensor device around in our bar.\nHere's the firmware dump, can you try to get anything from it?\nFlag structure: S3D{...}\n"}, {"name": "Generic Platformer", "desc": "A platformer gamer is an individual who engages in interactive digital experiences characterized by traversing a virtual environment filled with various obstacles, hazards, and puzzles.
