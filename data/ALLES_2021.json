But there is a catch this time: we didn't mint any flag tokens!\n\nIf you enjoy this challenge, make sure to check out the Solana Bug Bounty program.

Alternatively you can also use the official rust api, the official js api or any other way you can think of interacting with the RPC server. Solana also has a multitude of cli tools. Please note however that due to setup limitations, the TPU port of the validator is not exposed, which means the solana program deploy command will not work. The Solana PoC Framework has a function for this that only uses the rpc endpoint and will work.\n\nThe solana explorer works with any cluster your browser can reach. Just click on the Mainnet Beta button and enter the url of the RPC endpoint into the Custom text field. Checking the Enable custom url param checkbox might also be useful for collaboration. The explorer allows you to inspect accounts and transactions and has a bunch of useful features.\n\nThe goal of these challenges is to obtain a flag-token (mint F1agMint11111111111111111111111111111111111).

The instruction data is ignored, the first account has to be a spl-token account that contains a flag token and the second account has to be the owner of the token account.
