He hated his job. His only way out was to quit and move on to a different organization that would perhaps let him spread his wings and fly into the clouds.\n\nSo, one day he moved all his sensitive information to an AMI, changed the permission to public and left, so that he could extract the contents later, from his new office across the city. He thought this would not raise any red flags, oh but he thought wrong, didn't he?\n\nCan you find the AMI and check what was the data Hoffman was planning to steal?\n\nNote: The flag format for this challenge is BMCTF{flag}\n\nAuthor: @0xCriminal\n"}, {"name": "A bucket load of Samosa", "desc": "NaughtyDev is launching a new product called \u2018Naughtyide\u2019.\n\nThe admins of 'Naughtyide' like to use a lot of AWS services, their favorite being Amazon S3.\n\nHowever, they are very bad at security. There is news in the underground that someone has leaked some sensitive files into an S3 bucket but have poorly configured it making it available to the public.\n\nJust some additional info, last week two buckets were discovered called 'admin.naughtyide' and 'hr.naughtyide'.\n\nNote: Use this custom dictionary stolen from their servers to find the bucket and the flag file. You may have to edit the dictionary to align with the company's naming convention as shown above!
