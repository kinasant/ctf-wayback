Their services have gained popularity due to the nation's unstable currency, which many residents are reluctant to hold.\n\nWicaksono, the elder brother, operates a unique exchange. Unlike others, he willingly accepts the volatile national currency, offering people special \"market shares\" in return. These shares represent a stake in the local economy. Wicaksono, known for his shrewd financial acumen, personally calculates the value of these shares using complex formulas that few understand. As an added incentive, he provides small rewards to shareholders whenever possible, managing the pooled local currency with remarkable skill.\n\nNext door, his younger brother Budi runs a foreign currency exchange. Budi's business is equally crucial to the town, as he offers stable foreign currency in exchange for the market shares that Wicaksono issues.\n\nTogether, the brothers' businesses form a symbiotic system that has become the backbone of the local economy. Residents can exchange their unstable national currency for Wicaksono's shares, earn rewards, and then exchange these shares for foreign currency with Budi when needed.\n\nOne day, as the brothers sat down to review their monthly finances, they were shocked to discover something unprecedented. For the first time since they started their businesses, their ledgers showed no profit. In fact, they had lost a significant amount of money. Puzzled and concerned, Wicaksono and Budi pored over their books late into the night, trying to understand what could have gone wrong in their usually foolproof system.\n"}], "crypto": [{"name": "AESaaS", "desc": "Author: Wrth\n\nI believe a crypto player should be all rounder\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/AESaaS/chall"]}, {"name": "Chemistry Lab", "desc": "Author: BerlianGabriel\n\nCheckout my new chemistry experiment on using Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to encrypt images securely :)\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/Chemistry_Lab/chall.py"]}, {"name": "Tempus", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/Tempus/Dockerfile", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/Tempus/challenge.py"], "desc": "Author: merricx\n\nI found an old cryptography library, but it looks good and has some state-of-the-art features so I tried to use it for my project.\n"}, {"name": "exchange 1", "desc": "Author: swusjask\n\nJust learning about isogeny based cryptography, I hope there isn't something wrong.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/exchange_1/server.py"]}, {"name": "exchange 2", "desc": "Author: swusjask\n\nJust learning about isogeny based cryptography, I hope there isn't something wrong.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/TheCyberJawaraInternational/2024/crypto/exchange_2/server.py"]}], "forensic": [{"name": "P2PWannabe", "desc": "Author: Blacowhait\n\nUruzic is a protocol network maniac! he want make protocol byself by combine 2 protocol he loved!
