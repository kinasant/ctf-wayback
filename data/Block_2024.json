{"crypto": [{"name": "Glitch in the Crypt Exploiting Faulty RSA Decryption", "desc": "A high-security server, SecureVault Inc., uses RSA encryption to protect sensitive data. The server utilizes a 1024-bit RSA key and employs the CRT optimization during decryption to improve performance.\n\nDue to a hardware fault, the server occasionally introduces errors during the decryption process. Specifically, the fault affects the computation of m_p = c^{d_p} mod p during the CRT step, causing m_p to be incorrect, while m_q = c^{d_q} mod q remains correct.\n\nAs an experienced cryptanalyst, you have managed to obtain access to the server's decryption service. Your goal is to exploit the faulty decryption results to recover the prime factors p and q of the RSA modulus n, effectively breaking the encryption scheme and recovering the private key.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Block/2024/crypto/Glitch_in_the_Crypt_Exploiting_Faulty_RSA_Decryption/server.py"]}, {"name": "Sizer Cipher", "desc": "I made my own encryption scheme- check it out!\n\n052c01be88c7f52cbdc3c084c7b1313828034370034dd13778342dff\n"}, {"name": "Wheres My Key", "desc": "The flag server is providing encrypted flags.
