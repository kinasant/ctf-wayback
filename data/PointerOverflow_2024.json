This time we're getting back to basics. Kindergarten stuff. If you've never done a challenge like this before, don't be intimidated. This is all about learning the ABCs of password cracking. It's just four simple steps, repeated twice. What you learn here might not apply to all password cracks, but it will at least get you through this one.\n\nA. Always read up on your cipher. Research is the most important step. Do this twice because it's proven that repeated exposure improves learning.\nB. Be prepared. Download a good wordlist. It doesn't hurt to do that twice, too, since the first one might get worn out if it takes a long time to crack.\nC. Calibrate your password cracking rig. I use an RKO King Kong for mine. Then calibrate your other cracking rig. My backup is a Kempe Gowda 3.\nD. Dead chicken. In the 90's, there was an idiom in the computer world: \"Wave a dead chicken.\" The idea being that you do everything to prepare and at a certain point all you can do is pray the thing works. Well, you might as well wave two dead chickens, because all you can do now is wait for it to finish.\n\nBelow is a diagram to help you understand the cipher.\n\nI'll also tell you that the password uses only A-Z.

Our journey from the edge to the center as we orbit it... That's a spiral. A shape we see often in nature. In fact, you probably see it every day. I know I do. As I stand at the sink and watch the water flow around into the dark void of the drain. And so, in essence, we're all circling the drain. Enjoying our trip around and around until we also return to the dark void of the Great Hereafter... We cannot correct our errors. They have already been made. If you choose to leave the world a better place than you came to it, then all you can do is examine those errors. See them for what they really are. Then leave a message for those earlier in their journey. But this is easier said than done. Perspective is difficult to maintain. The truth is often right in front of us, but we miss it because we're blinded by... Pick your poison. Hubris. Fear. Righteousness. Or just the petty distractions we create to avoid the existential crisis that comes, when left alone too long with our thoughts, with the irresistible urge to turn around to look at how quickly we're nearing the edge of the drain and how deep and dark the void really is...\n\nCheck out this cool optical illusion I found!\n\nMD5 checksum 5C210367D7F4AA13C834EC73AE947994\n"}, {"name": "A Record of Events", "desc": "Here's a simple forensics challenge for you.

Now you get to make your own grid! One thing you might notice about ciphers is that a lot of them, historically, were devised by brilliant people in administrative positions. After all, no one needs to keep secrets more than power-brokers. This one is no different. This method was developed by a master of diplomacy and strategy that navigated the complex world of court politics with ease, often serving as the voice of authority behind the throne. His talent for administration and negotiation earned him wealth and prestige, though his success bred many enemies. Despite his brilliance, his fortunes were tied to the favor of the ruler he served. When the tides of power shifted, his downfall was as swift as his rise. His legacy remains one of both extraordinary achievement and the fragility of influence in the volatile arena of royal politics. Oh, and you'll need a key for this one. It's a single word and your clue is \ud83d\udd5b + \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nMy first step is your last and.... Wait... This can't be right. MORE grids? That doesn't make sense. How many grid ciphers could there possibly be?? Hmm... Oh, ok this one also has transposition. So we get a little of that flavor, too. Well, you know who else, historically, has created lots of ciphers? Nerds. Nerds working for the military, generally. Geniuses, really, and like all geniuses they are rarely appreciated in their time. The developer of this cipher faced his share of criticism in his day, but is now well-regarded as one of the great code-breakers that bridge the gap between classical and modern methods. To solve this, you'll need some letters from a number... Just a second my random number generator in my brain is running... Ok, I am thinking of a number.

Like, it's almost as if several of the challenges contained clues that hinted that a certain method was employed, and then it turns out that they actual indicated some other method. It's honestly starting to bother me. It's like knowing that something is just a little bit off but not being able to identify it. Like there's unfinished business to tend to.

A multi-billion dollar, Fortune 500, international corporation. You'd think a business like that would have all kinds of resources invested in IT, but that wasn't the case.\n\nThe whole company hinged on an inventory system. If it went down the company started treading water immediately. This inventory system was released in 1986 and was written in Cobol. The original programmers were kept on retainer to handle problems when they cropped up, and these people were well in to their golden years.\n\nI used to think about how untenable this was, and wondered to myself about what the company would do when their time finally came. By the time I came around, there were only three of them left, and only two of those had worked on the most important portions of the program. The last one only did code reviews on the least significant bits, and even he was part of the eternal work of maintaining this single program!\n\nI asked DALL-E to whip up a representation of the lengths the company would go through to avoid change.

It's true. It never really worked out. Probably because I wasn't very good. Still, for a good portion of my 20's I did the whole thing with garage bands and trying to get recognized and everything. I really wanted to make a mark on the world, but didn't really have any means to do it. So I did the next best thing and I made a lot of noise to be heard. Never seemed to work, though. Always fell on deaf ears. I gave up the dream after I entered university and discovered my next passions, and that brings us together today!\n\nStill, I've always had an affinity for music. Even as the years of loud music take their toll on my poor ears. I'm luckier than some since my hearing is still pretty good. Still I get tinnitus ringing in my ears more often now and I know when that happens that it means that I'm waving goodbye to another frequency of sound. The only bonus is that now I can play annoyingly high pitched sounds to irritate the youngsters and it doesn't bother me a bit!\n\nAnyway, I managed to find an old recording of my jazz drummer days to share with all of you.
