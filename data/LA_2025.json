We need to know which students' submissions were compromised (downloaded by a malicious actor) ASAP. Unfortunately, the only logs we have are proxy logs, and the professor refuses to give us the code or access to their web app (they claim they just immediately deleted the app's code once they realized they were hacked...).\n\nThe team at Microsoft has generously provided everyone with a free log analysis cluster, no credit card needed!

Unfortunately, this means it's hard to know whether 2 requests from the same IP are the same person, or 2 different people, even if the user agent is the same.\n    We've narrowed down the attack to a 3 hour window, which is (roughly) what the logs provided contains.\n    Note that TAs also downloaded submissions - do not consider their downloads as \"leaks\"!\n    Submission IDs are sequentially assigned to submissions as they submit, starting from the first submission in the log as ID 1, and are globally unique. You can assume there are no other submissions outside of the provided log.\n    We suspect the number of compromised accounts is between 100 and 1000, counting the number of unique students IDs that had their submissions downloaded by the malicious actor, even if a student submitted multiple times.\n    If you are 100% certain your answer is correct, and you've read all of the notes, but the submission is not taking your answer, feel free to open a support ticket, but make sure to provide the KQL query(s) you are using to get your answer.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/LA/2025/misc/insecure_submission/insecure-submission-logs.csv.gz"]}, {"name": "mikumikubeam", "desc": "r2uwu2\n\nMiku miku beaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/LA/2025/misc/mikumikubeam/create.sh", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/LA/2025/misc/mikumikubeam/mikumikubeam.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/LA/2025/misc/mikumikubeam/mikumikusteg.png"]}, {"name": "sneckos lair", "desc": "aplet123\n\npepega the Silent   HP 1/66   Floor 29 - Ascension 20   Turn 1\nSnecko   HP 122/122   Intent: Perplexing Gaze\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/LA/2025/misc/sneckos_lair/dist.tar.gz"]}, {"name": "tokens please", "desc": "aplet123\n\nThe glorious country of Arstotzka has switched to cryptocurrency to better audit transactions.
