Remember AutoRun? We've brought it back! But this time with Security\u2122.\n\nOur new autorun works on ZIP files. Include a file ending in `.autorun.py`, and when we unzip the zip file, we'll run it for you. However, your script must have a proprietary DevMaster Signature\u2122.\n\nIn this alpha release, we've provided a valid ZIP file that you can try out. This is because our engineers are out for the weekend celebrating the launch, and won't be signing new files any time soon. Only a human can make sure you don't read the `/home/user/flag` file, after all. Sandboxing tools that would prevent that definitely don't exist.\n\nOf course, we unzip the file with our new, proprietary, ultra-speedy `turbozipfile` extension. It's a drop-in replacement for `zipfile` (read-only).\n\n# Running the challenge\n\nYou can test locally with `python3 ./autorunner.py ./zipfile.zip ./unzip_dir`. \n\nYou can run remotely with `./send_zip.py ./zipfile.zip <host> <port>`. We'll unzip the file for you, and if there's a signed and valid `.autorun.py`, we'll run it. The server uses Python 3.8.\n\n# Some tips\n\nWe strongly recommend Python 3.8+. We've provided `turbozipfile` as a compiled module for python 3.8, as well as the C source. You can compile for a different Python version with `python3 ./setup.py build`; however, this is not required. This challenge does not require native coverage or sanitizers in order to be solved.\n\nAtheris is still in active development, and we recently released significant improvements. These change how Python coverage works, so be sure to read the right documentation for the version you're using: [new](https://github.com/google/atheris/) vs [old](https://github.com/google/atheris/tree/1.0). Both versions work for this challenge.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/autorunner.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/public_key", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/sample.zip", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/send_zip.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/setup.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/turbozipfile.c", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Atheris/turbozipfile.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so"]}, {"name": "Compression", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/GoogleCTF/2021/pwn/Compression/compress"]}, {"name": "Full Chain", "desc": "# Fullchain\n\nChromium is built from commit `1be58e78c7ec6603d416aed4dfae757334cd4e1e`.
