Phase Two (Equinox) \u2013 A pseudo-random shift was applied to each character (within printable ASCII range), controlled by a numeric seed.\n\nThe term \u201cAstra\u201d can metaphorically symbolize the act of mapping standard characters to a higher or \u201ccelestial\u201d representation\u2014here, it\u2019s the conversion of ASCII values into base-62 strings. Think of it as elevating ordinary letters/numbers to a \u201cstarry\u201d or more complex format. \u201cEquinox\u201d represents the cyclical nature of shifting characters. In astronomy, an equinox is when day and night are of equal length, marking a cycle.
