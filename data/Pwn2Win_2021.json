However, buildings on the Island storing potentially compromising material, such as the human genetics centre, have a rigid access control system.\n\nLaura managed to compromise some computers in the government lab that develops this system. When analyzing the project, she found that the weakest point seems to be the electronic board that checks whether the access code to enter the buildings is correct. There is nothing special about the board itself: it is a Colorlight 5A-75B V7.0 board that, apparently, could be found very easily before the war. What is interesting is the bitfile programmed to the board, which is developed by the government lab.\n\nLaura got access to the bitfile that the lab is testing. The specifications accompanying the bitfile state that the board can be accessed at 200.18.104.100 on UDP port 6000 after being connected to the network. Upon receiving the correct access code, it returns a datagram beginning with OK. Otherwise, it returns NOK. The project is apparently based on a customized version of LiteEth. Still, Laura was unable to gain access to the complete source code.\n\nReverse engineer the bitfile to find out which access code is accepted by the board.\n\nCuriosity: If you don't have a Colorlight and want to see the bitfile working, you can submit it to Rhiza's test infrastructure. But it probably won't help you to solve the challenge. You really need to reverse engineer the bitfile.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/hw/the_ethernet_from_above/ethernetfromabove.bit"]}, {"name": "the real ethernet from above", "desc": "Shortly after Laura managed to reverse engineer the first version of the access control system, the government lab released a second version! The requirements document now contains the following specification: \"the bitfile should work correctly only when programmed to official government boards\".\n\nLaura recalled the report of a similar mechanism described in the time capsule files. In 2018, Brazil, the country to which the island belonged, implemented a similar mechanism in the DREs they used to elect their politicians.\n\nKnowing the Rhiza test infrastructure programs the bitfile provided by the user to an official government board, find out which access code is accepted by this new version of the bitfile.\n\nNote: You still need to reverse engineer the bitfile. But now, besides that, you also need to interact with the test infrastructure.\n\nImportant: The switch port to which the board is connected is filtered. Only packets coming from the 200.18.104.100 address are able to reach the internet.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/hw/the_real_ethernet_from_above/real_ethernet_from_above.bit"]}], "pwn": [{"name": "accessing the truth", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/accessing_the_truth/OVMF.fd", null, "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/accessing_the_truth/run.py"]}, {"name": "baby write only password manag", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/baby_write_only_password_manag/server"]}, {"name": "c mon see my vulns", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/c_mon_see_my_vulns/Dockerfile", null, "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/c_mon_see_my_vulns/csvparser.so", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/c_mon_see_my_vulns/entrypoint.sh", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/c_mon_see_my_vulns/flag.txt", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/c_mon_see_my_vulns/readflag.c", null]}, {"name": "enlighten me pt 1", "attach": [null, "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/enlighten_me_pt_1/enlightenme.sys", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/pwn/enlighten_me_pt_1/systeminfo", null]}], "rev": [{"name": "highest power", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/rev/highest_power/highest-power"]}, {"name": "the return of too slow", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/rev/the_return_of_too_slow/enc", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/rev/the_return_of_too_slow/v2_slow.com"]}], "web": [{"name": "hackus", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/hackus/docker-compose.yml"]}, {"name": "illusion", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/illusion/Dockerfile", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/illusion/entrypoint.sh", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/illusion/flag.txt", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/illusion/readflag", null]}, {"name": "ruthless monster", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/Pwn2Win/2021/web/ruthless_monster/server.zip"]}]}
