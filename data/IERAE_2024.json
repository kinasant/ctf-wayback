The spy was in charge of implementing a CGI used in our company product. Luckily, the CGI was still under development, which means we had no actual damage.\n\nNevertheless, I'm very curious what the spy have done. When I execute the CGI with ENABLE_DEBUG_CGI=1 ./setting.cgi \"500 test\", it somehow spawns a shell while it's originally supposed to just throw `1` as exception. Therefore, it's obvious that the spy patched somewhere in the CGI. But I can't see any diff in the disassembly. For your information, I attached both the original binary and the one patched by the spy. If you don't trust me, you can bindiff them. You can confirm that there's nothing different.
