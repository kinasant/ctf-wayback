With no other ideas for how to proceed, you choose to follow.\n\nWhat you see there is... confusing. There's something that looks like Godzilla attacking a skyscraper, but it seems to be made completely of metal. Mechagodzilla? And the military force you followed here doesn't seem to have a whole lot of weapons. Instead, from the vehicles, you see them unload tons upon tons of fresh fish, amassing them into one giant heap in the middle of the road. Are they trying to distract a mechanical monster with food? That doesn't sound like a great plan to you.\n\nAn onlooker beside you that you hadn't noticed up to this point suddenly pipes up. \"That's a lot of fish,\" he states flatly.\n\nHe's not wrong, you suppose.\n\nAs you watch on, for just a moment, you see a corner of a flag sticking out of the pile of fish, before being covered up by some cod and salmon that are added to the top of the pile.
