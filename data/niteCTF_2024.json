The attacker manipulated several features in a critical training dataset, altering only a few values to make detection difficult.

After investigating the hacker's device, you discovered a search history that included various anomaly detection techniques and cryptography methods.\n\nAmong the logs, you found an intercept from an article that might help us understand how the flag was concealed.
