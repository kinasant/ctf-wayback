This term encompasses the idea of breaking a substitution permutation network through the use of randomized and strategic attacks on the substituted boxes, engaging in a battle against the complexity and obscurity of the encryption. The unique and catchy abbreviation adds to the appeal and memorability of the challenge, making it a perfect moniker for this intriguing task. Additionally, the wordplay on \u2018wear\u2019 implies both the effort and persistence required to succeed in such a challenge, and the concept of clothing or cloaking, which is a common technique used in cryptography. Overall, RandSubWare conveys the essence of the challenge, its nature, and provides an eye-catching and engaging title for this endeavour.\nThis single-word name captures the spirit of breaking a substitution permutation network through randomization, strategy, and persistence, making it a fitting title for this fascinating cryptographic challenge. It provides a concise yet informative representation, providing an appealing and memorable representation for participants and observers alike. With its clever use of language and association with the world of cryptography, RandSubWare sets the stage for an exciting and captivating challenge that will test the mettle of even the most seasoned cryptographers.\n", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/SekaiCTF/2023/crypto/RandSubWare/chall.py"]}, {"name": "cryptoGRAPHy 1", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/SekaiCTF/2023/crypto/cryptoGRAPHy_1/DES.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/SekaiCTF/2023/crypto/cryptoGRAPHy_1/GES.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/SekaiCTF/2023/crypto/cryptoGRAPHy_1/server.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/SekaiCTF/2023/crypto/cryptoGRAPHy_1/utils.py"], "desc": "Graphs have gained an increasing amount of attention in the world of Cryptography.
