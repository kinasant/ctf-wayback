Satoshi told that he had locked the flag in that digital safe and the key to open it has some relation with his block number 691604, as the key is same as that of hash of the block, if it was mined 5 minutes before, with same nonce. Well it's Inception and Cobb has decided to find it in his dream, if incase he needs some more hints from Satoshi. You are Cob, can you get the flag before the dream finishes?\n\nhttps://crypto-inst-2.vulnfreak.org/\n"}, {"name": "Exclusive", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Exclusive/chall.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Exclusive/out.txt"]}, {"name": "Fake Encryption", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Fake_Encryption/chall.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Fake_Encryption/ff_error.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Fake_Encryption/ff_error.png.enc", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Fake_Encryption/flag.png.enc"]}, {"name": "Invisible Cipher", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Invisible_Cipher/chall.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Invisible_Cipher/flag.enc"]}, {"name": "Rem Shinobu Asuna", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Rem_Shinobu_Asuna/chall.py", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Rem_Shinobu_Asuna/out.txt"]}, {"name": "RoboXOR", "desc": "Rick got a robot named \"XORius\" as a gift by his parents which activates with a key, in user manual it was written - \"we suggest you to use your name is X factor for ROBO ^_^\" so Rick followed the user manual, his bot was working fine and now started saying \"2506110631060d103c5a15582036045b3c075734640015580d10531e0d1c134a2f\"\n\nBut now Rick has fear of his parents and he wants your help to understand his ROBO\n"}, {"name": "Sir Oracle", "attach": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/main/ctfs/WORMCON/2021/crypto/Sir_Oracle/server.py"]}, {"name": "whats my wallet address", "desc": "Satoshi has a digital safe having a crypto wallet and flag for this level in it.
