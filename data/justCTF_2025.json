Life support is failing, communications are dead, and the orbiting relay has gone silent. The only hope lies in restoring the capsule's core systems. But the capsule was never meant to launch solo \u2014 it was built to be assembled piece by piece in a controlled lab, not reconstructed by paw in the wreckage of a crash site. Armed with salvaged tools, jury-rigged firmware, and sheer determination, the Otternaut begins to assemble the launch capsule manually, installing exo-frame parts, calibrating avionics, and overriding water-efficiency protocols. If every component fits \u2014 and every test passes \u2014 the capsule might just ignite. But the odds are thin.

But there's a problem: the cell is guarded, and the only way in is through corruption. Bribing a Council guard comes at a steep cost \u2014 and the Otternaut has no funds left. Desperate, they turn to the Cryon Underbank, a shadowy lender of last resort. A loan is granted, but with strict terms: every borrowed Cryon Credit must be returned. No exceptions.
